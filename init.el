This is a thin wrapper around `package-vc-install' in order to
make non-interactive usage more ergonomic.  Takes the following
named arguments:

- FETCHER the remote where to get the package (e.g., \"gitlab\").
  If omitted, this defaults to \"github\".

- REPO should be the name of the repository (e.g.,
  \"slotThe/arXiv-citation\".

- NAME, REV, and BACKEND are as in `package-vc-install' (which
  see)."
